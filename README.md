# LearningKotlin

This project contains a handful of challenges taken from DailyProgrammer.

The purpose is simply to teach myself Kotlin and have a little fun while doing so.

I will be implementing the solutions using Kotlin's language features where I can so the implementations may not be the "ideal" solutions.
